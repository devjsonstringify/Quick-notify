# chrome-extension-notification

This is extension was built by needs, i want something that will notify me in periodically or at a specified time in the future. So i develop this chrome extension with basic user interface and does the job.  Just input the time when to fire or notify you ( for now only in minute(s) is allowed) Then tell something what to remind you about.  Will be adding more features, also if you like my extension let's talk i love talking to you.
